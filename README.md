# Repeater_Tarot

Tarot that utilizes Intention Repeater Tech.

THINK_DEPTH of 5000 means each card is selected at "random" 5000 times before that card is chosen.

Note, this does not yet account for reversals. Due to the nature of randomness, one would get reversals
half the time. So I have found it best not to worry about those, since they don't usually come
up in my readings anyway.
